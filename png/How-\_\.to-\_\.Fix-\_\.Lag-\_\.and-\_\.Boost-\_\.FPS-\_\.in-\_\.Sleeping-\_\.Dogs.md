To update your graphics drivers, you can use a driver updater tool that can automatically scan your PC and install the latest drivers for your graphics card. Alternatively, you can manually download and install the latest drivers from the official website of your graphics card manufacturer.
 
Another thing that can affect the performance of Sleeping Dogs is your Windows version. If your Windows is not updated or has some issues, it may cause conflicts or errors with the game. To update your Windows, you can go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and check for any available updates.
